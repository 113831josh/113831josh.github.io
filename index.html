        <h2>Claim</h2>
    <p>I think there is nothing in the Black Box. Think of it like a water bottle with a hole in it. 
      If you fill it up to the line and keep going, it will eventually just let everything go 
      back out through the hole and the water line will be back at the line right above the hole. </p>
    <h2>Evidence</h2>
    The mystery black box worked oddly. Water went in, paused, then more water, then all of the water came out. 
Our model's key component was the bucket with the looped tube; water would go in, pause, more water goes in, and then it all comes out at the same time. 
    However, when we began to conduct experiments, the water began to leak out the bottom. We did not know if the bucket was poorly made or if this just was 
    not the answer. We also got the majority of the same numbers for each trial, the first, no water came out, then for the rest the amount put in came out.
 <h2>Reasoning 1</h2>
   <p>IF the thing inside of the black box model was anything like ours, we probably would not have gotten as much water from the output because 1. It would 
     have been slower and 2. Theres a higher chance of it falling apart
    <h2>Reasoning 2</h2>
    <p>Something that can explain there being nothing in there is when it first leaked out the bottom corner. It could have been something just blocking it 
      but eventually the water had moved it so it had leaked.
    <h2>Reasoning 3 </h2>
    IF the thing inside of the black box model was anything like ours, we probably would not have gotten as much water from the output because 1. 
    It would have been slower and 2. There's a higher chance of the box falling apart.
  <p> This is the black box model me and my team came up with, 
    except it is just a diagram so you can get a better idea on how the parts co-exist with one another. </p>

    <p> This is the live model of the box model, with all parts seen. However, the exit tube might be harder to see because it is see through.

    <p> This is the data chart, and it shows all of our trials and the outcomes we got fro each individual one. Each is rounded to the nearest hundred, which is why they are all so similar.
