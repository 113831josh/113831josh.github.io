    <h1>What is inside the black box?</h1>
    <h1>Claim</h1>
    <p>I think there is nothing in there. Think of it like a water bottle with a hole in it. 
      If you fill it up to the line and keep going, it will eventually just let everything go 
      back out through the hole and the water line will be back at the line right above the hole. </p>
    <h1>Reasoning 1</h1>
   <p>Something that can explain there being nothing in there is when it first leaked out the bottom corner.
    It could have been something just blocking it but eventually the water had moved it so it had leaked.
    <h1>Reasoning 2</h1>
    <p>Another thing that can also explain it is trial number 5, when 4x the amount of water came out.
    If the 500mL was put in all at the same time, it could have overflowed the line while also creating
    waves which explains why there was so much for this one.
    <h1>Reasoning 3 </h1>
    If the thing inside of the black box model was anything like ours, we probably would not have gotten as
    much water from the output because 1. It would have been slower and 2. There is a higher chance of it falling apart.
