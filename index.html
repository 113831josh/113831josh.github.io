    <h1>There is nothing in the black box!</h1>
    <p>I think there is nothing in there. Think of it like a water bottle with a hole in it. 
      If you fill it up to the line and keep going, it will eventually just let everything go 
      back out through the hole and the water line will be back at the line right above the hole. </p>
